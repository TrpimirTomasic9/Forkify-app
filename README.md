# Forkify Recipe Application

Forkify is a recipe application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to search for recipes, view recipe details, adjust servings, and add ingredients to a shopping list. This project was inspired by [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) on Udemy, particularly the Forkify section.
